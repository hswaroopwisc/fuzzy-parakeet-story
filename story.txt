There was once a parakeet named Linux that was very fuzzy. Linux lived on an island in the middle of the ocean.

Linux was best friends with another parakeet named Windows. Linus was very jealous of his friend beceause everyone loved Windows and never paid any attention to him.

One day, he had had enough and he changed his name to Windows so that he could be loved and accepted as well. He life got wild from there. 

The original Windows convinced the rest of the parakeets to banish Linus for taking his game.  Linus was forced to fly out to see and was never seen again.
